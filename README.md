#  Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning  

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. The aim is to use machine learning models to assist in early detection and decision-making.

##  Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, scaling, etc.)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model training with ML algorithms (SVM)  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy)  
- Interactive prediction script for user input
